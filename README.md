## Problem Statement

#=================================
#I made this project as soon as I learned how to program in python. A lot of the code is inefficient since I didn't knew a lot of functions, numpy and pandas.
#=================================

Analyze non-emergency 'Housing and Building' complaints reported to the 311 system in NY.<br>
__(1) Determine which type of complaint is the most common.<br>
(2) Where is this type of complaint more concentrated.<br>
(3) Determine if there is an obvious house/building characteristic that can help predict this particular type of complaint.<br>
(4) Build a model that can predict this type of complaints based on house/building characteristics.__
